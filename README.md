# Sorting Algorithms Performance Analysis

---

## üè´ **About This Project**

Welcome to the **Sorting Algorithms Performance Analysis** repository! This project was developed to provide an in-depth exploration of popular sorting algorithms, with a focus on analyzing their performance under various conditions. It aims to serve as a learning and benchmarking tool for computer science enthusiasts and students.

## üìö **Objective**

The purpose of this project is to:

‚úÖ Compare different sorting algorithms across diverse input types.  
‚úÖ Implement fundamental sorting techniques in C.  
‚úÖ Measure and analyze the performance of each algorithm in terms of execution time, comparisons, and swaps.

## üí° **What is Sorting?**

Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science, where the goal is to arrange the elements of an array or list in a specific order, typically ascending or descending. Sorting is essential in various applications, from searching algorithms to data visualization.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Algorithms Implemented**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Bubble Sort**
   - Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.  
   - **Time Complexity:**  
     - Best Case: O(n)  
     - Average/Worst Case: O(n^2)  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Selection Sort**
   - Selects the smallest (or largest) element and places it in its correct position.  
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Insertion Sort**
   - Builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting elements in their correct position.  
   - **Time Complexity:**  
     - Best Case: O(n)  
     - Average/Worst Case: O(n^2)  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Quick Sort**
   - Divides the array into partitions based on a pivot and recursively sorts the partitions.  
   - **Time Complexity:**  
     - Best Case: O(n log n)  
     - Worst Case: O(n^2)  
     - Average Case: O(n log n)  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Merge Sort**
   - Divides the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges them.  
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n log n)

## üõ†Ô∏è **Tech Stack**

- **Programming Language:** C  
- **Tools:** GCC for compilation  
- **Development Environment:** Visual Studio Code

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

Follow the instructions below to run the project on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SortingAlgorithm.git
cd SortingAlgorithm
```

---

### 2. Compile the Source Code

You can compile the source code using `gcc`. For example:

```bash
gcc sorting_algorithms.c -o sorting_algorithms.exe -Wl,--stack,16777216
```

---

### 3. Run the Program

After compilation, run the executable:

```bash
sorting_algorithms.exe
```

The program will automatically execute all sorting algorithms across predefined array sizes and input types. Results will be saved to `sorting_results.csv`.

---

## üèÜ **Features**

‚úÖ Multiple sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.  
‚úÖ Performance metrics: Execution time, comparisons, and swaps are measured.  
‚úÖ Diverse input types: Sorted, reversed, and random arrays.  
‚úÖ Results exported to `sorting_results.csv` for further analysis.
